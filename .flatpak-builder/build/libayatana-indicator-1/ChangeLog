2009-04-08 Eitan Isaacson

          all objects down to the menu now use the gtkstyle naming
          from FUSA to ensure that they all pick up the theme hacks
          that are set for FUSA.  (LP: #334490) (13aa4e5)
        * debian/libindicate0.install changed to
          debian/libindicate1.install;  New upstream version:   *
          Adds new API for detecting interests of various listeners.
           Implemented     on both client and server side.  (LP:

        * Clearing another warning.  Shame gdk doesn't do this one for us.
          (75002ff)
        * Patch from Eitan Isaacson to correct prototype.  Had to be adjusted
          slightly as the prototypes had moved. (9a7bcf3)
        * Ignoring our new test (7115f77)
        * Patch from Eitan Isaacson to remove a ref/unref infinite loop that
          effectively made it so that we kept our objects forever.
          While we love them, at some point we need to say goodbye.
          (eba8697)
        * Making it so that we don't register the object twice.  This is
          really a work around, but it's atleast fixes the crasher.
          Which sucked.  We need to work with the dbus folks to make
          this better. (3e1e512)

          (98d4485)
        * I finally understood what seb128 told me about the version
          numbering. I feel so stupid for not understanding before
          :) (7f23e11)
        * Hiding some debugging messages. (912a2a1)
        * Simplifying error message (9bd1519)

          changings properly;  Correctly use g_list_remove in
          several cases making for long lists;  Using g_list_prepend
          instead of append because it's faster.;  Checking whether
          we've got proxies before destroying them. (42492db)

2009-04-03 Ted Gould

        * Not quite sure how these got added, but I'm not going to fight it.
          (05b5aa4)
        * Trying to get to a sane state.  I apparently don't know as much
          about library versioning as I thought I did. (4f5d2b5)
        * Hiding all of the functions that part of the DBus interface in that
          now they're all prefixed with '_' so that they don't get
          exported as part of the library symbols.  This should
          simplify everything a little bit for implementors.
          (d93da3d)
        * Getting rid of everything starting with 'd'.  This gets rid of the
          dbus stuff that isn't set up to be static, which is silly.
          (eb5078b)
        * Hiding the marshsallers from the libraries in the symbols by adding
          a _ in front of them. (be4c002)
        * Cleaning up the exported symbols, make sure that 'get_type_cb'
          isn't exported (303c52b)
        * Getting to version 0.2.0 (c9b2fe4)
        * Trying to have more style information included so that we can get
          rid of the focus line. (68d7bf9)
        * Adding interests on new servers saying that we're displaying the
          indicators and in the server. (16abe6d)
        * Fleshing out the functions in the listener to set interests.
          (96c1883)

2009-04-02 Ted Gould

        * Putting in some protection from crazy values (68fb067)
        * Hiding debug (2f66ceb)
        * Adding a bunch of debugging messages and fixing the lifecycle for
          the folk pointer.  Lots'o'fun.  But things seem to be
          working. (5c9e92e)
        * Filling in the dbus owner changing code.  Now we should catch
          those. (6826848)
        * Adding printouts for interest changes. (1554425)
        * Connecting in the DBus messaging that we need. (26bfe1c)

        * Woot!  Now we have some real functions to call! (5ebb3c4)
        * I can't believe I messed up this one.  Luckily it doesn't seem to
          have caused any bugs.  Man. (b874768)
        * Switching around the show_interest and remove_interest functions so
          that they are now asyncronous.  Not that being
          asynchronous is important but more that now they get the
          Method Invocation interface that we can use to find out
          the sender of the message.  Changed various APIs as a
          result of this, and moved the DBus functions to be

          API.  Now to fill in the backend. (58403a8)
        * Adding a remove and show interest (966a1e5)
        * Change the API so it's more like we're keeping a list of what, and
          who are interested in.  This'll make it easier for us to
          manage all the DBus nastyness. (bae37d9)
        * Adding stuff to ignore, much better (e6287ab)
        * Misspelling (7fea958)

          detect people on the system vs. the session bus.

        * debian/copyright: Fix download location. (78eda23)
        * Add bzr-builddeb configuration (merge mode). Fortunately this
          doesn't insist on having *only* debian/ in bzr. This gives
          us the best of both worlds, bzd-bd auto-downloading
          orig.tar.gz and merging in the pre-generated autoconf
          stuff, and retaining the possibility of merging directly
          from trunk, since we keep the full upstream source in this

          panel-lib (3e126a2)

          seem to do it. (8336b57)

          the messages more clear between the two. (524e5b9)
        * Adding a new signal in that handles the ID of zero, or null,
          comming back from a listener and uses that to show the
          server.  Or atleast signal it to figure out how to do
          that.  Also cleaning up the signals a little to use
          defines. (3a3a6e5)
        * Adding a check for NULL string in the icon parsing code.  This will

        * Adding in support for icons, specifically passing them back and
          forth on the bus (3eb4043)
        * Changing from using a memory stream to using a buffer, the memory
          stream one seems to be broken. (6b3a32c)
        * Adding in the function to take a pixbuf, turn it into a png, base64
          encode it and then send it across the wire. (a2e77d6)

          have to worry about those details. (ee27474)
        * Setting the properties property and picking up Empathy's desktop
          file (8a2cf34)

          the type of the server. (3ca33fc)
        * Building a way to get properties.  Seems like this should be in the

          liked. (49220be)

          if we're still visible. (eb7ca97)

        * Changing the signals for show/hide to send the type correctly.
          (af60279)
        * Setting the type of the server (455dbe3)

2009-02-06 Ted Gould

        * Merging in the trunk changes (c18cbee)
        * Adding properties for doing type and desktop (c4db8e8)
        * Changing the DBUS API slightly.  Now there is no 'get_desktop'
          function as desktop is a property.  Added a property for
          type so that we can understand what kind of application
          this is.  And finally adding show/hide signals on the
          server as they were already on the listener. (a14b6dd)
        * releasing version 0.1~ppa27 (e6ff0d4)
        * releasing version 0.1~ppa23 (d52c59b)

            * Removing targets for files in libindcate-dev.install
          * Removing pkg-create-dbgsym;  Adding a build depend on
          pkg-create-dbgsym (3c879bc)

2009-02-03 Neil Jagdish Patel

        * Allow sub-classes of server to emit signals using three new public
          functions (67d2967)

2009-02-02 Ted Gould

        * Adding a print message for when the indicator is signaled (21a212b)
        * Adding an interface to call back to an indicator and display it.
          (2adf895)

2009-01-29 Ted Gould

        * Guess I should merge trunk back in at some point. (d9e7ed9)
        * Fixing the handling of named DBus connections;  Moving most of
          the data in the objects to private sections;  Making the
          signal names defines for easier usage;  Having property
          changes actually work now. (17bc0da)
        * Changing the include directory from 1.0 to 0.1 which gives us more
          room to screw up (de80300)
        * Wow, I didn't realize we weren't handling properties at all
          correctly.  Fixed now.  Whew. (fab825e)
        * Adding a set property after the show to cause a signal (054c9ba)
        * Have the server pass along the property modified signal (f5e7d6d)
        * Adding a property modified signal to the indicator object (dd60c62)
        * Making all of the server values move into a private section like
          all the others.  Generally a good thing and good clean up
          (759d62b)
        * Making the indicator properties private, they should be.  Also
          cleans up some deps. (c0a3238)
        * Removing the gobject-introspection-repository from the list of
          build depends as we needed it for the dbus stuff, that
          we're no longer using. (d898b21)
        * Removing DBus from the gobject introspection (d2f37fb)
        * Oops, forgot the header there (116ff8e)
        * Okay, moving all of the variables from the listener class into a
          private object.  This is to make the GObject introspection
          not need dbus, and thus we can reduce our build deps
          significantly. (82c65bf)
        * Use the new fangled defines to make things cleaner (ab78f47)
        * Getting some helper defines for some of the hacks that'll probably
          change in the future (63630dc)
        * Using the defines for the signal names (5454aee)
        * Making the signals use #defines to make everything a little more
          predictable.  I hate this part of GObject signals.
          (fea68aa)
        * Adding a variable to make the compiler happier (492652a)

2009-01-26 Ted Gould

        * Changed to only listen to reference names instead of descriptive

        * Moving the gir file to the right package (dbe2080)
        * Removing the gir file from the applet so that it's only with the
          library so that we can install all of them. (7a5bf13)
        * Adding the GObject Introspection files into the build and the
          packaging. (ba631e9)
        * Shell script integrated into the autotools system (e3f1f4e)
        * Bringing GObject Introspection into the build and making it so that
          it gets installed with the library. (ac140d5)
        * Build fix (e83283e)
        * Adding in libtool to build deps (09d01e6)
        * Getting the debian package built up so that it can have a seperate
          library binary package. (0eb5899)
        * Changing the build targets, now I understand the difference between
          'any' and 'all' (872812a)
        * Making it so the lib only uses glib (which it does) (913c9d2)
        * Adding in the libindicate lib. (28c26d8)
        * Moving the tests so that they can guarantee to build after the
          library builds as otherwise they end up getting built
          first. (8f80127)
        * Adding in a return that was missing (though it's useless) (487239d)
        * Building the listener object that listens to all of the folks on
          DBus and turns that into a usable interface for indicator
          display folks.  A lot of code to make things simple :)
          (2b6ce30)
        * Handling the case that we're destroying an entry because the bus
          told us to.  Properly signalling all of the removals
          (df1713a)

2009-01-15 Ted Gould

        * Fixing the printing and the saving of indicators. (ad1cc2d)
        * Changing the test to do the printing by itself instead of using the
          debug messages in the class itself (fe3addb)
        * Getting the signals in shape (0d1e01e)
        * Okay, adding the other signals in and keeping track of the
          indicators that are hanging around.  Now, to connect to
          things external. (2722037)
        * Get the type of the list of indicators that we got, and then set
          the up to register (0ff1165)
        * Now correctly calling the get indicators function to get the
          indicators on already created objects. (fb5b330)
        * Adding in a marshaller for the DBus signals that we need (e50f228)
        * Now doing some DBus listening and getting some of the initial
          configuration built up. (d1c2ed2)
        * Changing to the dbus interface and changing to build teh client and
          server interfaces (421cea2)
        * Amazing how a little string can make such a huge difference.
          (4c623e4)
        * Adding in a basic listening test (da2657e)
        * Adding a new function (6ba4025)

        * Cut-and-paste error (48277fb)

2009-01-14 Ted Gould

          bugs that I expect to find :) (8a2369b)
        * Cleaning up prototypes and type warnings. (284b3dd)
        * Who the hell would design an API that passes in arrays of strings
          differently than it passes them out.  What an insane idea.
           Oh yeah, properties work. (bda3bbf)
        * Merging in code from yesterday.  Got many of the functions working
          with real IDs and making lists.  The basis for all the
          properties stuff is there but it still needs a touch of
          fleshing out.  Also a new test for debugging. (89bf87a)
        * Chaning the property list parameters to be pointer arrays.
          (c145922)

        * Forgot to actually add the test (f64b5d9)
        * Ah, we weren't checking if we were visible.  Now things are better.
          (0b4e54d)
        * Return to crashing beauty (bba89ed)
        * Add a test to create a lot of indicators. (3dbe51d)
        * Merging in Robert's changes. (5030c34)

2009-01-13 Robert Carr

        * Add script to build GObject-introspection GIR, and boilerplate
          JavaScript test. (71820cb)
        * Use G_BEGIN/END_DECLS, and put the GOBject *_get_type functions in
          the header file (needed by introspection, but also the
          normal GLib style). (27a71bb)
        * Merge Ted's changes. I should have used bzr bind. (544dec8)
        * Add pkgconfig file. (35c5045)

2009-01-12 Ted Gould

        * Fleshing out more functions, we can now return a list of ids.  Need
          to test with more. (5525628)
        * Whoo Hoo, we can count (cd4f548)
        * Fleshing out the whole show and hide thing.  We should also be
          signalling when indicators are added or removed from the
          server. (514837a)
        * Clean up the signal handlers and fixing the call in the test
          function.  Now we're to the point of showing the way I
          think things should be. (2dc2f26)
        * Basic show hide support in the indicator (3d55f90)
        * Changing to showing the inicator and make it so that we dont' crash
          right now. (b687b3a)
        * Adding in the base functions with pointers and fun stuff like that
          (245fdda)

2009-01-11 Ted Gould

        * Adding in signals so that we can talk to the app over DBus.  Nice.

        * Okay, we're all doing everything perfect (bbc5347)
        * Making the applet a lot more sparce.  Now we're going to load

          (854bab0)
        * Removing everything except messaging. (e1092da)

        * Whoa, getting that inherited type wrong really messes things up.
          (13ad9d4)
        * Clean compile, but something is broken in the _init function.  Not
          sure what. (a29584a)

2008-11-19 Ted Gould

        * Okay, blocked the prelight on the item, now how do I get my buttons
          out of event prison. (712bddc)
